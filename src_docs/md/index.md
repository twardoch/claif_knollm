## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install claif-knollm
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from claif_knollm import KnollmClient, ModelRegistry

# Initialize the client with intelligent routing
client = KnollmClient(routing_strategy="cost_optimized")

# Search for models
registry = ModelRegistry()
models = registry.search_models(
    query="gpt-4",
    max_cost_per_1k_tokens=0.01,
    required_capabilities=["function_calling"]
)

# Make a completion request
response = await client.create_completion(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}],
    model="gpt-4o-mini"  # Or let Knollm choose automatically
)
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# List all providers
knollm providers list --tier premium

# Search for models
knollm models search --capability vision --max-cost 0.02

# Get library recommendations
knollm libraries recommend --use-case "structured_output"

# Find cheapest models
knollm models cheapest --capability function_calling
```
