```

### Core Components

**üîç ModelRegistry**
: Comprehensive database of 10,000+ models with capabilities, pricing, and performance metrics.

**üè≠ ProviderRegistry**  
: Configuration and status management for 40+ LLM providers.

**üß≠ KnollmClient**
: Main interface for making requests with intelligent routing and failover.

**‚ö° RoutingEngine**
: Algorithms for selecting optimal providers based on cost, quality, speed, and availability.

## Key Features

### Universal Provider Support

Connect to any LLM provider through a unified interface:

```python
from claif_knollm import KnollmClient

# Works with any provider automatically
client = KnollmClient()
response = await client.create_completion(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

### Intelligent Model Selection

Let Knollm choose the best model for your needs:

```python
from claif_knollm import ModelRegistry, ModelCapability

registry = ModelRegistry()

# Find optimal models automatically
model = registry.find_optimal_model(
    required_capabilities=[ModelCapability.VISION],
    max_cost_per_1k_tokens=0.01,
    min_quality_score=0.8
)
```

### Cost Optimization

Minimize your LLM expenses automatically:

```python
from claif_knollm import KnollmClient, RoutingStrategy

# Always choose the cheapest suitable option
client = KnollmClient(routing_strategy=RoutingStrategy.COST_OPTIMIZED)
```

## Common Use Cases

=== "Chatbots & Assistants"

    Build cost-effective chatbots that automatically scale across providers:
    
    ```python
    client = KnollmClient(
        routing_strategy=RoutingStrategy.COST_OPTIMIZED,
        fallback_providers=["groq", "deepseek", "openai"]
    )
    ```

=== "Content Generation"

    Generate high-quality content with optimal provider selection:
    
    ```python
    client = KnollmClient(
        routing_strategy=RoutingStrategy.QUALITY_OPTIMIZED,
        required_capabilities=[ModelCapability.TEXT_GENERATION]
    )
    ```

=== "Code Analysis"

    Analyze code with models specialized for programming:
    
    ```python
    registry = ModelRegistry()
    code_models = registry.search_models(
        required_capabilities=[ModelCapability.CODE_GENERATION],
        sort_by="quality_score"
    )
    ```

=== "Vision Tasks"

    Process images with the best vision models:
    
    ```python
    vision_model = registry.find_optimal_model(
        required_capabilities=[ModelCapability.VISION],
        quality_threshold=0.9
    )
    ```
