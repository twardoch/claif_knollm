## Featured Strategies

### Cost Optimization Quick Wins

Immediate ways to reduce your LLM costs:

1. **Use Cost-Optimized Routing**
   ```python
   from claif_knollm import KnollmClient, RoutingStrategy
   
   client = KnollmClient(routing_strategy=RoutingStrategy.COST_OPTIMIZED)
   ```

2. **Set Budget Limits**
   ```python
   client = KnollmClient(
       max_cost_per_request=0.01,
       daily_budget=50.00
   )
   ```

3. **Choose Budget Providers**
   ```python
   client = KnollmClient(
       fallback_providers=["groq", "deepseek", "together"]
   )
   ```

### Reliability Quick Setup

Ensure your application stays online:

1. **Multiple Fallback Providers**
   ```python
   client = KnollmClient(
       fallback_providers=["openai", "anthropic", "groq", "deepseek"]
   )
   ```

2. **Health Check Monitoring**
   ```python
   health_status = await client.check_provider_health()
   ```

3. **Automatic Retry Logic**
   ```python
   client = KnollmClient(
       max_retries=3,
       retry_backoff=2.0
   )
   ```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Smart Fallback Chain

```python
from claif_knollm import KnollmClient, RoutingStrategy

client = KnollmClient(
    routing_strategy=RoutingStrategy.BALANCED,
    fallback_providers=[
        "openai",      # Primary: High quality
        "anthropic",   # Backup: Also high quality  
        "groq",        # Budget: Fast and cheap
        "deepseek"     # Emergency: Very cheap
    ]
)
```

**Use Case:** Production applications that need reliability with cost control.

### Pattern: Development vs Production

```python
import os
from claif_knollm import KnollmClient, RoutingStrategy

# Different strategies for different environments
if os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "production":
    client = KnollmClient(
        routing_strategy=RoutingStrategy.QUALITY_OPTIMIZED,
        fallback_providers=["openai", "anthropic"]
    )
else:
    client = KnollmClient(
        routing_strategy=RoutingStrategy.COST_OPTIMIZED,
        fallback_providers=["groq", "deepseek"]
    )
```

**Use Case:** Optimize costs in development while ensuring quality in production.

### Pattern: Task-Specific Routing

```python
from claif_knollm import ModelRegistry, ModelCapability

registry = ModelRegistry()

async def route_by_task(task_type: str, messages: list):
    if task_type == "coding":
        # Use specialized code models
        model = registry.find_optimal_model(
            required_capabilities=[ModelCapability.CODE_GENERATION],
            max_cost_per_1k_tokens=0.005
        )
    elif task_type == "analysis":
        # Use high-quality reasoning models  
        model = registry.find_optimal_model(
            required_capabilities=[ModelCapability.REASONING],
            min_quality_score=0.9
        )
    else:
        # Use general-purpose budget models
        model = registry.find_optimal_model(
            max_cost_per_1k_tokens=0.002
        )
    
    return await client.create_completion(
        messages=messages,
        model=model.id
    )
```

**Use Case:** Optimize model selection based on specific task requirements.

## Performance Tips

### Latency Optimization

- **Use Regional Providers** - Choose providers with servers near your users
- **Enable Caching** - Cache common responses to avoid repeated requests
- **Batch Requests** - Process multiple requests together when possible
- **Async Operations** - Use async/await for concurrent processing

### Cost Optimization

- **Token Management** - Monitor and optimize token usage
- **Model Selection** - Use smaller models for simpler tasks
- **Request Optimization** - Craft efficient prompts
- **Budget Monitoring** - Set alerts before limits are reached

### Reliability Improvements

- **Multiple Providers** - Never depend on a single provider
- **Health Monitoring** - Continuously check provider status
- **Circuit Breakers** - Temporarily disable failing providers
- **Graceful Degradation** - Have fallback behavior for failures
